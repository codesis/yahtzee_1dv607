# Yahtzee assignment for the course 1DV607
A fun, traditional game written for the console in c#!

#### How to install
There is one rather simple way to play this console game. First you need to fork the repository and then in your terminal write "dotnet run" when you're positioned in the folder. 

To be able to use the command "dotnet run", you need to have .NET Core which can be download from [*here*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

#### How to play
When you enter "dotnet run" in your terminal, a couple of choices will be presented. You make your choice using the keyboard as the messages tell you to do. You will have a choice of viewing previous games' highscore, either in full or in short. Then you have a choice of playing 1-5 players and maybe you even want all of the players to be AI (Artificial Intelligence, played by the computer) or maybe you want to play all by yourself or with friends? It's up to you! 

Instructions are presented as you play.

Have fun, and good luck!

To be finalized: the possibility to resume a previous saved game. At time being, the implementation is faulty and will not work accordingly. A message in the terminal will tell you how to proceed.

#### Documentation
Within the folder Documentation you shall find three different diagrams. Two are a class diagram over the full application (one is the updated version, one the older incomplete one - it's obvious by their names), the other is a sequence diagram for playing the game.
